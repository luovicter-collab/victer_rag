It amounted to a redefinition and amalgamation of established business activities, notably \"logistics\" (integrated transport, warehousing, and distribution) and manufacturing-based \"operations management\".

We therefore define a supply chain as: \"the network of organizations that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages, in the different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services in the hands of the ultimate consumer\" [7]. The notion of networks is particularly important and its relevance to this study will become apparent throughout this paper, but the key point is that modern supply chains are not simply linear chains or processes. They are complex networks. The products and information flows travel within and between nodes in a variety of networks that link organizations, industries and economies. "

We have taken care to avoid some of the pitfalls of synonyms, in particular we distinguish between \"resilience\" and \"robustness.\" In practice the two terms are used interchangeably, but in the context of supply chains they can acquire quite different connotations. To aid clarity we have adopted the following dictionary derived definitions. We have taken \"robust\" to mean \"strong or sturdy in physique or construction.\" Here the emphasis is on physical strength. In IT terminology \"robustness\" is \"the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution.\" A robust process may be desirable, but does not itself equate to a resilient supply chain. We are using the term \"resilience\" as it relates to supply chains as networks, so have adopted a dictionary-based definition that is rooted in the science of ecosystems. We define resilience as \"the ability of a system to return to its original state or move to a new, more desirable state after being disturbed.\" The implication in this definition is the notion of flexibility, and given that the desired state may be different from the original, \"adaptability\" also earns a place in our thinking.

UPF was the sole supplier of chassis for the Land Rover's bestselling model, the Discovery. The receivers, KPMG, threatened to halt supply unless Land Rover made an immediate up-front payment of between £35 and £40 million. KPMG justified its actions by pointing out that it was legally obliged to recover money on behalf of its creditors and the sole supplier agreement represented a valuable asset. The action followed an earlier court ruling in the UK that had determined that receivers were legally entitled to exploit a customer's vulnerability for the benefit of creditors. Land Rover faced the very real possibility of having to shut down production of the Discovery until a temporary injunction was secured granting the car-maker a short-term reprieve. The injunction allowed Land Rover to arrange for another supplier to acquire the failing business, averting the lay-off of 1400 Land Rover workers and many more among the car maker's network of suppliers.

This research follows on from an exploratory study of Supply Chain Vulnerability by the Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management, undertaken in 2001 on behalf of the UK government's Department for Transport, Department of Trade and Industry (DTi) and the Home Office. The impetus for the study was the widespread economic disruption experienced in the UK by fuel protests in September 2000 and the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in February 2001. The work was already well underway by the time of the terrorist attacks on the USA on September 11, 2001, though these events demonstrated the timeliness and relevance of the work. "

This provided a working definition of supply chain vulnerability as \"an exposure to serious disturbance, arising from risks within the supply chain as well as risks external to the supply chain.\" The distinction between risks internal and external to the supply chain is in practice an artificial one, though it offers a welcome point of reference in reviewing and positioning other bodies of work.

Beyond that, the research concluded that a number of tools should be provided to assist organizations, large and small, in the identification and management of supply chain risks [10].

They may be the result of socio-political, economic or technological events many miles or organizations removed from the focal firm's own supply chains, but may have carry-over effects through linkages to other industry networks. The type or timing of these events may be predictable (i.e., those arising from regulatory changes), but many will not be, though the impact of these types of events may still be assessed. However, our research revealed instances where organizations had every opportunity to identify forthcoming disruptions, but either failed to do so. The industrial action affecting the US West Coast ports in 2002 was one such example. Well ahead of the actual events the likelihood of disruptions was discussed in the press and on television news channels. The same channels later reported the massive disruptions to supply chains experienced by those who did not head the warnings. "

In other words there is frequently only a limited exchange of information between adjacent entities in a network. For example a supplier to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may have no information on the rate of sale that the manufacturer is achieving, only receiving sporadic orders with the expectation that delivery can be made within an ever-shorter timescale. The reality is that most organizations are \"forecast-driven\" rather than \"demand-driven\" and are forced to take decisions in isolation of each other. While this lack of shared information is a source of considerable additional cost to the supply chain as a whole, it is also a significant source of vulnerability. "

Consequently, many were unable to readily identify appropriate tools and techniques which might be employed to manage the panoply of potential risks. Furthermore, while some form of business continuity planning exists within most large businesses, business continuity management has been slow to take into account the risks that emanate from the wider supply/demand network. It is our contention that many of the threats to business continuity lie outside the focal firm, hence the need for a much broader perspective when it comes to contingency or continuity planning. "

This may not be the lowest cost course of action in the short term but may provide an opportunity to reduce the impact of a disruption if and when it occurs. There is an analogy here with \"Real Options Theory\" in investment planning. Thus a strategy that is based around centralization of distribution facilities may be the lowest cost option but it could also shut down other options and hence increase vulnerabilities. - Re-examine the \"efficiency vs. redundancy\" trade off. Conventionally surplus capacity and inventory have been seen only as \"waste\" and are therefore undesirable. However, the strategic disposition of additional capacity and/or inventory at potential \"pinch points\" can be extremely beneficial in the creation of resilience within the supply chain. The trade-offs inevitably involve the judgemental balancing of the cost handicap involved in maintaining slack \"just-in-case\", against the probability and likely impact of a negative event. Not a message that hard pressed corporate executives are necessarily willing to hear. Nevertheless, if resilience is to be taken seriously, surplus capacity may well be the lesser evil, being more flexible than inventory, which may already be committed to its final form or destination. Both capacity and inventory can provide \"slack\" in a supply chain to enable surge effects to be coped with. Inventory, carried in a generic or semi-configured form, can enable the creation of a \"de-coupling point\" which, together with additional capacity (i.e., production, transport, people), can enable demand uncertainty to be more effectively managed. While not advocating a return to the days of buffering every stage in the supply chain with safety stock or excess capacity, we do suggest that the strategic and selective use of \"slack\" "

Indeed, a key to agile response is the presence of agile partners upstream and downstream of the focal firm. Two key ingredients of agility are \"visibility\" and \"velocity.\" Supply Chain Visibility. Put very simply, supply chain visibility is the ability to see from one end of the pipeline to the other. Visibility implies a clear view of upstream and downstream inventories, demand and supply conditions, and production and purchasing schedules for example. It also implies internal visibility with clear lines of communications and agreement on \"one set of numbers.\" Visibility in a supply chain can be obscured by the presence of intervening inventories upstream and downstream of the focal firm. These intervening inventories are usually created independently of each other as a result of decision rules, the basis of which may not be readily apparent. Visibility will be further distorted by the presence of the bullwhip effect [19] that can magnify small changes in marketplace demand as it moves back up the supply chain. "

One of the key conclusions of our research is that supply chain risks present the most serious threat to business continuity and yet as our research revealed, paradoxically, not every company has supply chain management represented in its own right in the Board Room. If the supply chain has a voice at all at that level it is often represented through IS/IT Directors or Vice-Presidents. While this can work, it is often the case that in such instances the understanding of what constitutes supply chain risk is limited to an information systems based perspective. "

The paper sets out a framework for improved supply chain risk identification based on a process control perspective, assisting the manager in identifying sources of risk, in terms of their location relative to the focal firm. The authors recognize that other approaches to the segmentation and identification of supply chain risk are presented within the literature cited, but not from a normative managerial perspective as is the intention here. The exploration of these other approaches is beyond the scope of this paper. The routemap framework for supply chain resilience is put forward in the same spirit, drawing as appropriate on widely accepted principles of demand-driven supply chain management together with useful perspectives borrowed from risk management in other spheres, including finance.
