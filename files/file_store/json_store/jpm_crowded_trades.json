        "text": "ABSTRACT: Crowded trades are often associated with bubbles. If investors can locate a bubble sufficiently early, they can profit from the run-up in prices. But to profit from a bubble, investors must exit the bubble before the sell-off erodes all of the profits. The authors propose two measures for managing exposure to bubbles. One measure, called asset centrality, locates crowded trading, which they show is often associated with the formation of bubbles. The other is a measure of relative value, which helps to separate crowding that occurs during a bubble’s run-up from crowding that occurs during a bubble’s sell-off. Neither measure by itself is sufficient for identifying the full cycle of a bubble, but the authors show that together these measures have the potential to locate bubbles in sectors and in factors as they begin to emerge and to identify exit points before they fully def late.

        "text": "TOPICS: Portfolio construction, factors, risk premia, risk management* rowded trading refers to the deployment of a large amount of capital to purchase or sell an asset or a group of assets with similar characteristics, which can result in a significant change in the price of the assets. It is important to note, however, that not all large price moves are caused by crowded trading. If investors perceive a change in the fundamental value of an asset, its price should adjust whether or not there is crowded trading. However, when prices change significantly from a shift in investor psychology or infatuation with a new strategy, it is likely due to crowded trading. This distinction is critical. Price adjustments that correspond to shifting fundamentals should persist indef initely, which makes them difficult to exploit, but price adjustments that occur in the absence of a shift in fundamentals are more likely to be transitory and, therefore, more easily exploitable. This type of crowded trading, in which asset prices rise and fall significantly without a commensurate change in fundamental value, is commonly referred to as a bubble. Our goal in this article is to demonstrate how to locate bubbles and to determine whether they are inf lating or def lating. "

        "text": "The academic community is undecided about whether it is possible to detect bubbles before they crash. For example, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Fama (2014) stated: “The available research provides no reliable evidence that stock market price declines are ever predictable.” In a Chicago Booth Review interview, Fama (2016) added: “Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.” In response to this challenge, Greenwood, Shleifer, and You (2017) evaluated 40 US and 107 international bubbles, which they defined as events in which prices increased by at least $100 \\%$both on an absolute and relative-to-market basis. They found that price increases alone do not reliably predict negative expected returns, though they do predict a larger probability of loss. The authors also found that variables such as increased volatility, new stock issuance, and price acceleration have the potential to differentiate price increases that crash from those that continue to rise.

        "text": "We present a different approach for predicting bubbles than Greenwood, Shleifer, and You. We use asset centrality as a proxy for crowded trading to locate bubbles, and we combine this signal with a measure of relative value to distinguish crowded trading that occurs during a bubble’s run-up from crowded trading that occurs during its sell-off. We also use a somewhat loose def inition of a bubble. Whereas bubbles are typically associated with a spectacular run-up and sell-off, we def ine a bubble as any signif icant increase and decrease in prices that is not associated with a corresponding change in fundamentals. Along these lines, Cornell (2018) argued that small bubbles and crashes should be very common in markets, possibly as a result of limits to arbitrage or trading that occurs for any reason other than an assessment of fair value.

The absorption ratio is commonly used to measure risk concentration.2 Finally, we define centrality by noting a given sector’s weight (as an absolute value) in each of the eigenvectors that comprise the subset of the most important eigenvectors (those in the numerator of the absorption ratio). We then multiply the sector’s weight in each eigenvector by the relative importance of the eigenvector, which we measure as the percentage of variation explained by that eigenvector divided by the sum of the percentage of variation explained by all of the eigenvectors comprising the subset of the most important ones. This gives a measure of centrality, which is defined in Equation 2.3 In Equation 2, $C _ { i }$equals a sector’s centrality score, $A R ^ { j }$is the absorption ratio of the jth eigenvector, $E V _ { i } ^ { j }$equals the absolute value of the exposure of the ith sector within the jth eigenvector, n equals the number of eigenvectors in the numerator of the absorption ratio, and $N$equals the total number of sectors.4 To lend some intuition to centrality, think about this computation using only the first eigenvector as the numerator in the absorption ratio. This special case would be very similar to the technique used in Google’s PageRank algorithm (see Brin and Page 1998). Think of each asset group as a node on a map. By defining an importance score as the sum of all of its neighbors’ importance scores (times some constant), that score would equal precisely the weight of the sector in the first eigenvector.5 We instead use several eigenvectors in the numerator of the absorption ratio because most of the time several factors contribute importantly to asset variability.

        "text": "Now consider how crowded trading affects volatility and connectivity. Crowded trading raises a sector’s volatility in two ways. First, when a large quantity of capital is deployed to purchase or sell a particular sector, it leads to large order imbalances, which result in large price adjustments and, hence, greater volatility. Second, the components within the sector become more correlated with each other as investors focus their trades on the sector as a single unit rather than distribute their trades independently across the components of the sector. Volatility therefore rises as the sector becomes less diversified. We would also expect to see an association between crowded trading and connectivity. As investors crowd into sectors, these sectors become bellwethers and, therefore, drive the behavior of other sectors, which raises their connectivity. "

It is a heat map of the cross-sectional percentile ranks of centrality through time for the major sectors of the US equity market. Centrality rises as the colors shift from dark blue to light blue to green to yellow to orange to light red to dark red.6 Notice that the centrality of the tech sector is very high during the tech bubble and that centrality is also very high for the f inancial sector during the global f inancial crisis and very high for the energy sector during periods of volatile energy prices. Also note that for decades the centrality of REITs (real estate investment trusts) was the lowest of any sector, but it rose noticeably during the housing bubble that led to the f inancial crisis. "

Unfortunately, centrality by itself is of little value for timing exposure to bubbles because, although it rises as a bubble begins to emerge, it continues to rise throughout the entire bubble cycle and often more steeply during a bubble’s sell-off. We, therefore, introduce a measure of relative value to separate centrality that occurs during a bubble’s run-up from centrality that occurs during its sell-off. "

As this occurs, centrality continues to rise because crowding persists but now in the opposite direction. Indeed, crowding is usually more intense when investors exit a trade than when they enter it. This crowded selling drives down the relative value of the group, typically early during a bubble’s sell-off or at least before the sell-off has run its course. "

Investors believed this strategy would protect them from stock market losses greater than $5 \\%$,8 so they invested in stocks more aggressively than they might have otherwise. In mid-October 1987, the stock market responded negatively to news that Congress would seek to limit interest deductions on debt used to finance acquisitions. The portfolio insurance rules then triggered more selling, which fed upon itself, causing the stock market to crash more than $20 \\%$in a single day. "

Based on the evidence provided from these historical bubbles, we next seek to determine if we can deploy these measures in a sector rotation strategy as well as in a strategy for timing exposure to factors. However, we must f irst resolve a serious challenge, which is that these historical bubbles fail to suggest uniform thresholds for centrality and relative value. We address this problem in two ways. First, rather than focus on the absolute level of centrality, we focus on its change in value, measured as a standardized shift. Second, we compare these measures cross-sectionally; hence, we focus on their relation to one another rather than their individual absolute values. "

As we mentioned earlier, we do not limit our definition of a bubble to major price inf lation and def lation. We consider a bubble as any significant increase and decrease in price that occurs without a corresponding shift in fundamentals. Moreover, we are not so ambitious as to seek to identify the precise beginning, peak, and end of all bubbles. Rather, our goal is to identify the run-up and sell-off phases sufficiently early for enough bubbles so as to add significant value to a passive equity strategy. We next describe how we calibrate our measures of centrality and relative value. "

        "text": "Exhibit 4 shows annualized performance relative to the S&P 500 Index for portfolios composed of sectors that are not crowded and sectors that are crowded when those sectors are not overvalued and when they are overvalued. It reveals that crowding and relative value by themselves do not provide useful information. However, when used in combination, they are particularly potent. Sectors that were not relatively overvalued but were relatively crowded delivered the best performance. This outcome supports our conjecture that these sectors were in bubble run-ups. In contrast, sectors that were relatively overvalued and crowded had the worst performance, which supports our conjecture that these sectors were selling off. The numbers in italics are the return-torisk ratios.10 They indicate, not surprisingly, that bubble sell-offs are more volatile than bubble run-ups. "

Second, the factor timing strategy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by $6 . 3 \\%$. This greater outperformance suggests that, even if factors do not deliver risk premiums, it is still possible that factor timing can add value, just as sector rotation adds value even though aggregate sectors, by construction, cannot outperform the market. Third, for those who care more about relative performance, the factor timing strategy produced a significantly higher information ratio than the static factor portfolio. "

        "text": "value to identify when a bubble transitions from its inf lationary phase to its def lationary phase. We showed that centrality, by itself, is insuff icient for managing exposure to bubbles because it continues to rise and, often, more sharply when crowding coincides with a bubble sell-off. Also, relative value, by itself, is inadequate for managing exposure to bubbles because it fails to distinguish price changes that occur in response to changes in fundamental value from those that result from a shift in investor psychology or herding toward a new strategy. We found, however, that these measures used in tandem could identify run-ups and sell-offs of sector and factor bubbles. We produced a backtest showing that investors could have significantly outperformed the US equity market as well as several foreign equity markets by employing a sector rotation strategy based on these measures. We also produced an additional backtest showing that investors could have significantly outperformed the US equity market as well as a static factor portfolio by using these measures to time exposure to factors. We also applied the same methodology used in Exhibits 4 and 8 to US industries and commodities, which produced consistent results. The annualized spread between the run-up and sell-off phases for US industries was $7 . 6 \\%$, and for commodities it was $1 1 . 1 \\%$. These results suggest that our methodology has applications to many other markets and investment universes. "
