We have taken care to avoid some of the pitfalls of synonyms, in particular we distinguish between \"resilience\" and \"robustness.\" In practice the two terms are used interchangeably, but in the context of supply chains they can acquire quite different connotations. To aid clarity we have adopted the following dictionary derived definitions. We have taken \"robust\" to mean \"strong or sturdy in physique or construction.\" Here the emphasis is on physical strength. In IT terminology \"robustness\" is \"the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution.\" A robust process may be desirable, but does not itself equate to a resilient supply chain. We are using the term \"resilience\" as it relates to supply chains as networks, so have adopted a dictionary-based definition that is rooted in the science of ecosystems. We define resilience as \"the ability of a system to return to its original state or move to a new, more desirable state after being disturbed.\" The implication in this definition is the notion of flexibility, and given that the desired state may be different from the original, \"adaptability\" also earns a place in our thinking."

UPF was the sole supplier of chassis for the Land Rover's bestselling model, the Discovery. The receivers, KPMG, threatened to halt supply unless Land Rover made an immediate up-front payment of between £35 and £40 million. KPMG justified its actions by pointing out that it was legally obliged to recover money on behalf of its creditors and the sole supplier agreement represented a valuable asset. The action followed an earlier court ruling in the UK that had determined that receivers were legally entitled to exploit a customer's vulnerability for the benefit of creditors. Land Rover faced the very real possibility of having to shut down production of the Discovery until a temporary injunction was secured granting the car-maker a short-term reprieve. The injunction allowed Land Rover to arrange for another supplier to acquire the failing business, averting the lay-off of 1400 Land Rover workers and many more among the car maker's network of suppliers."

Searches undertaken for this project confirmed that although issues of terrorist attacks on infrastructure were dealt with at length, specific references to disruptions to supply chains were conspicuously absent."

Furthermore, many organizations currently lacked an awareness of the need to consider the resilience of their supply chains as part of their overall approach to risk and business continuity management. Beyond that, the research concluded that a number of tools should be provided to assist organizations, large and small, in the identification and management of supply chain risks [10]. These conclusions have shaped the terms of reference for the subsequent program of research into \"Supply Chain Resilience\" that is the subject of this paper."

In particular these articles discuss the need for and the implications of antiterrorism measures implemented by the US authorities, and their impact on domestic business and international trade [11]. The US-based industry association, the Council of Logistics Management has published a weighty report, entitled \"Securing the Supply Chain.\" This report focuses on aspects of civil emergency and disaster management [12]."

In practical terms this may not be possible, but the focal firm should at least strive to familiarize itself with those risks that are known or likely to affect adjacent organizations.

They may affect a particular value stream (i.e., product contamination) or any node or link through which the supply chain passes (i.e., as the result of an accident, direct action, extreme weather or natural disasters). They may be the result of socio-political, economic or technological events many miles or organizations removed from the focal firm's own supply chains, but may have carry-over effects through linkages to other industry networks. The type or timing of these events may be predictable (i.e., those arising from regulatory changes), but many will not be, though the impact of these types of events may still be assessed. However, our research revealed instances where organizations had every opportunity to identify forthcoming disruptions, but either failed to do so. The industrial action affecting the US West Coast ports in 2002 was one such example. Well ahead of the actual events the likelihood of disruptions was discussed in the press and on television news channels. The same channels later reported the massive disruptions to supply chains experienced by those who did not head the warnings."

The findings of the empirical study revealed that practitioners frequently struggle to come to terms with the scope and variety of potential risks. Consequently, many were unable to readily identify appropriate tools and techniques which might be employed to manage the panoply of potential risks. Furthermore, while some form of business continuity planning exists within most large businesses, business continuity management has been slow to take into account the risks that emanate from the wider supply/demand network. It is our contention that many of the threats to business continuity lie outside the focal firm, hence the need for a much broader perspective when it comes to contingency or continuity planning."

While there has been a move towards the reduction of the supplier base in many companies, there may be limits to which the process should be pursued. Single sourcing, where one supplier is responsible for the supply of a specific item or service may be advantageous from a cost and quality management perspective, but is dangerous in terms of resilience. While it may be desirable to have a lead supplier, wherever possible alternative sources should be available. Where a firm has multiple sites it may be possible to have a single source for an item or service into each site thus gaining some of the advantages of single sourcing without the downside risk. Similarly if a manufacturing firm makes a range of products it may be possible to single source by product thus keeping an alternative source of supply available."

Conventionally surplus capacity and inventory have been seen only as \"waste\" and are therefore undesirable. However, the strategic disposition of additional capacity and/or inventory at potential \"pinch points\" can be extremely beneficial in the creation of resilience within the supply chain. The trade-offs inevitably involve the judgemental balancing of the cost handicap involved in maintaining slack \"just-in-case\", against the probability and likely impact of a negative event. Not a message that hard pressed corporate executives are necessarily willing to hear. Nevertheless, if resilience is to be taken seriously, surplus capacity may well be the lesser evil, being more flexible than inventory, which may already be committed to its final form or destination. Both capacity and inventory can provide \"slack\" in a supply chain to enable surge effects to be coped with. Inventory, carried in a generic or semi-configured form, can enable the creation of a \"de-coupling point\" which, together with additional capacity (i.e., production, transport, people), can enable demand uncertainty to be more effectively managed. While not advocating a return to the days of buffering every stage in the supply chain with safety stock or excess capacity, we do suggest that the strategic and selective use of \"slack\""

A high level of collaborative work across supply chains can significantly help mitigate risk. The challenge is to create the conditions in which collaborative working becomes possible. Traditionally supply chains have been characterized by arms-length, even adversarial, relationships between the different players. There has not been a history of sharing information either with suppliers or customers. More recently, however, there have been encouraging signs that a greater willingness to work in partnership is emerging in many supply chains. In the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry there is now significant collaboration between manufacturers and retailers in the form of Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) initiatives [17]."

The emphasis is on flexibility rather than economies of scale."

If the supply chain has a voice at all at that level it is often represented through IS/IT Directors or Vice-Presidents. While this can work, it is often the case that in such instances the understanding of what constitutes supply chain risk is limited to an information systems based perspective."

From the evidence contained in this limited but expanding pool of work the need for a structured approach to the management of supply chain risk was identified. The paper sets out a framework for improved supply chain risk identification based on a process control perspective, assisting the manager in identifying sources of risk, in terms of their location relative to the focal firm. The authors recognize that other approaches to the segmentation and identification of supply chain risk are presented within the literature cited, but not from a normative managerial perspective as is the intention here. The exploration of these other approaches is beyond the scope of this paper. The routemap framework for supply chain resilience is put forward in the same spirit, drawing as appropriate on widely accepted principles of demand-driven supply chain management together with useful perspectives borrowed from risk management in other spheres, including finance."
