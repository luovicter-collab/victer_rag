To aid clarity we have adopted the following dictionary derived definitions. We have taken \"robust\" to mean \"strong or sturdy in physique or construction.\" Here the emphasis is on physical strength. In IT terminology \"robustness\" is \"the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution.\" A robust process may be desirable, but does not itself equate to a resilient supply chain. We are using the term \"resilience\" as it relates to supply chains as networks, so have adopted a dictionary-based definition that is rooted in the science of ecosystems. We define resilience as \"the ability of a system to return to its original state or move to a new, more desirable state after being disturbed.\" The implication in this definition is the notion of flexibility, and given that the desired state may be different from the original, \"adaptability\" also earns a place in our thinking."

UPF was the sole supplier of chassis for the Land Rover's bestselling model, the Discovery. The receivers, KPMG, threatened to halt supply unless Land Rover made an immediate up-front payment of between £35 and £40 million. KPMG justified its actions by pointing out that it was legally obliged to recover money on behalf of its creditors and the sole supplier agreement represented a valuable asset. The action followed an earlier court ruling in the UK that had determined that receivers were legally entitled to exploit a customer's vulnerability for the benefit of creditors. Land Rover faced the very real possibility of having to shut down production of the Discovery until a temporary injunction was secured granting the car-maker a short-term reprieve. The injunction allowed Land Rover to arrange for another supplier to acquire the failing business, averting the lay-off of 1400 Land Rover workers and many more among the car maker's network of suppliers."

This provided a working definition of supply chain vulnerability as \"an exposure to serious disturbance, arising from risks within the supply chain as well as risks external to the supply chain.\" The distinction between risks internal and external to the supply chain is in practice an artificial one, though it offers a welcome point of reference in reviewing and positioning other bodies of work."

Beyond that, the research concluded that a number of tools should be provided to assist organizations, large and small, in the identification and management of supply chain risks [10].

They may be the result of socio-political, economic or technological events many miles or organizations removed from the focal firm's own supply chains, but may have carry-over effects through linkages to other industry networks. The type or timing of these events may be predictable (i.e., those arising from regulatory changes), but many will not be, though the impact of these types of events may still be assessed. However, our research revealed instances where organizations had every opportunity to identify forthcoming disruptions, but either failed to do so. The industrial action affecting the US West Coast ports in 2002 was one such example. Well ahead of the actual events the likelihood of disruptions was discussed in the press and on television news channels. The same channels later reported the massive disruptions to supply chains experienced by those who did not head the warnings."

Furthermore, while some form of business continuity planning exists within most large businesses, business continuity management has been slow to take into account the risks that emanate from the wider supply/demand network. It is our contention that many of the threats to business continuity lie outside the focal firm, hence the need for a much broader perspective when it comes to contingency or continuity planning."

While it may be desirable to have a lead supplier, wherever possible alternative sources should be available. Where a firm has multiple sites it may be possible to have a single source for an item or service into each site thus gaining some of the advantages of single sourcing without the downside risk.

The trade-offs inevitably involve the judgemental balancing of the cost handicap involved in maintaining slack \"just-in-case\", against the probability and likely impact of a negative event. Not a message that hard pressed corporate executives are necessarily willing to hear. Nevertheless, if resilience is to be taken seriously, surplus capacity may well be the lesser evil, being more flexible than inventory, which may already be committed to its final form or destination. Both capacity and inventory can provide \"slack\" in a supply chain to enable surge effects to be coped with. Inventory, carried in a generic or semi-configured form, can enable the creation of a \"de-coupling point\" which, together with additional capacity (i.e., production, transport, people), can enable demand uncertainty to be more effectively managed.

From the evidence contained in this limited but expanding pool of work the need for a structured approach to the management of supply chain risk was identified. The paper sets out a framework for improved supply chain risk identification based on a process control perspective, assisting the manager in identifying sources of risk, in terms of their location relative to the focal firm. The authors recognize that other approaches to the segmentation and identification of supply chain risk are presented within the literature cited, but not from a normative managerial perspective as is the intention here. The exploration of these other approaches is beyond the scope of this paper. The routemap framework for supply chain resilience is put forward in the same spirit, drawing as appropriate on widely accepted principles of demand-driven supply chain management together with useful perspectives borrowed from risk management in other spheres, including finance."
