Consequently, the concept of supply chain resilience (SCRes) has become crucial to complement the conventional risk management paradigm, which has failed to cope with unexpected SC disruptions resulting in severe consequences affecting SC performances and making business continuity questionable. Advancements in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and their potential to enhance SCRes by improving critical antecedents across different phases have attracted the attention of scholars and practitioners. The research from academia and the practical interest of the industry have yielded significant publications at the nexus of AI and SCRes during the last two decades. However, the applications and examinations have been primarily conducted independently, and the extant literature is dispersed into research streams despite the complex nature of SCRes. To bridge this gap, this study undertakes a systematic literature review involving 106 peer-reviewed articles. Through curation, synthesis, and consolidation of up-to-date literature, the study presents a comprehensive overview of developments spanning from 2010 to 2022. Bayesian networks are the most topical ones among the 13 AI techniques evaluated. Concerning the critical antecedents, visibility is the first ranking to be realized by the techniques. The study revealed that AI techniques support only the first 3 phases of SCRes (readiness, response, and recovery), and readiness is the most popular one, while no evidence has been found for the growth phase. The study proposed an AI-SCRes framework to inform research and practice to holistically approach SCRes. It also provided implications for practice, policy, and theory as well as gaps for impactful future research. ",

Supply chain resilience (SCRes) is the ability to proactively plan and design an SC network to anticipate unexpected disruptions and to adaptively respond by maintaining control over structure and function of a post-event robust state operation, if possible, better than the one before the disruption, thus gaining competitive advantage in the long run by bouncing back faster than the rivals (Abeysekara et al., 2019; Altay et al., 2018; Belhadi et al., 2021c; Dubey et al., 2019; Gölgeci & Kuivalainen, 2020; Ivanov, 2021; Juttner & Maklan, 2011; Kaviani et al., 2020; Kwak et al., 2018; Spieske & Birkel, 2021; Zavala-Alcívar et al., 2020). Instead of addressing disruptive risks in a piecemeal fashion, with resiliency, organizations intend to address disruptions with a system approach (Pettit et al., 2019). The concept of resilience greatly appeals to the organization. However, its effective adoption needs the development of various capabilities aligned with the SC partners (A. Ali et al., 2017). Among others is an IT approach that promotes business continuity (Naz et al., 2021), a culture of readiness in contingency actions, long-term partnerships, and government policy that supports flexibility (Katsaliaki et al., 2021).

The concept of supply chain resilience (SCRes) has emerged as a reaction to increased disruptions in supply chains (Ivanov, 2021) and inadequacies of the classical risk management paradigm, which is an event-oriented approach for well-known and predictable disruptive events (Agarwal et al., 2021; Fiksel, 2015; Juttner & Maklan, 2011; Mandal, 2020; Hohenstein et al., 2015; Pettit et al., 2013; Zavala et al., 2019). Fiksel (2015) argues that in the face of complexity and turbulence, when disruptions are often unknowable and unforeseen, risk assessment, one of the tasks of the classical risk management paradigm, becomes intractable, and its practices are no longer adequate. Adaptation may be needed to remain competitive in the face of disruptions. Fiksel (2015) further stresses that not all risks are identified or anticipated and may be hard to quantify. ",

This evolution led to AI's utilization for data analytics and predictive modeling, aiding in anticipating and managing disruptions effectively. Research intensified as awareness grew about the vulnerability of SCs, leading to greater exploration of AI techniques roles in addressing disruptions. Consequently the use of AI and related technologies in SC risk management and resilience increased in response to SC disruptions. Consistent with the recent systematic review works, our survey indicates that in the years 2019 and 2020, the applications of AI techniques made the maximum contribution which was due to the Covid-19 global pandemic that revealed the vulnerability and the lack of resilience in SCs across the globe (Ganesh & Kalpana, 2022; Golan et al., 2020; Iftikhar et al., 2022; Naz et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Spieske & Birkel, 2021; Younis et al., 2021).

In SCs, Intelligent agents can represent players like suppliers, customers, manufacturers, retailers, etc., and adjust their behavior to anticipate, respond adaptively, and recover from predicted and unpredicted disruptions when modeling supply chains with multi-agent intelligent systems (Baryannis et al., 2019a). Through their learning capability, MAIS can efficiently demonstrate the proactive and autonomous behavior of the participating agents in mitigating and rectifying SC disruptions in real-time (Bansal et al., 2005; Giannakis & Louis, 2011; Kwon et al., 2007; L. Lu & Wang, 2008). Multi-agent systems have been used as simulation tools for inventory management to reduce costs and improve fill rate, to resolve collaboration issues among supply chain entities that arise due to uncertain supply and demand, and to reduce costs and the bullwhip effect in a multi-stage supply chain (Baryannis et al., 2019a).

Visibility ensures confidence in managing a risk event situation in supply chain networks (Christopher & Peck, 2004; Jüttner & Maklan, 2011; Singh et al., 2019; Wichmann et al., 2020). Invisibility in SC networks severely hampers SC actors' capability to respond to any disruptions (Jüttner & Maklan, 2011; Mubarik et al., 2021). As complex SC networks are characterized by limited visibility, potential disruptive risks are hidden, and the cascading effects might not be noticed (Fiksel, 2015). As SC visibility reduces the probability and impact of SC disruption, it leads to SC resilience (Dubey et al., 2019). The works by (Mubarik et al., 2021) and (Wieland et al., 2013) empirically validated the positive impact of visibility on SCRes. ",

Velocity focuses on the organization's pace of flexible adaptations (Stevenson & Spring, 2007), with lead time as a key indicator of SC velocity (Jüttner & Maklan, 2011). This includes organizations' flexibility to respond quickly to disruptions in manufacturing, transportation, sourcing, or labor (Hohenstein et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2019; Spieske & Birkel, 2021). In order to benefit from \"the first mover advantage\" that disruptive events entail during disruptions, velocity is a critical antecedent of SCRes that can shift the SC to a better performance than the pre-disruption phase. Firms that adapt quickly may identify upside opportunities and capture competitive advantages before their competitors (Fiksel, 2015; Ribeiro & Barbosa-Povoa, 2018). Since velocity helps discover disruptive events in a timely manner (before they occur if possible), helps to quickly respond when they occur, aids in recovering fast, and helps to grow in disruption times by gaining competitive advantages (Patel et al., 2022), it can be considered a SCRes antecedent that contributes to the four phases.

Kim et al., 2015) and controlling the bullwhip and ripple effects emanating from operational and disruptions risks respectively (Hosseini et al., 2019). In addition to cost and customer services, SC configuration, a critical antecedent of SCRes, considers resiliency as one of the objective functions of SC network optimization (Christopher & Peck, 2004). The supply chains' growing global, less vertically integrated, lean-oriented, and the rapid advances in technology and customers' expectations have made SC networks vulnerable to disruptions of unplanned and unpredicted events (Baryannis et al., 2019b; Christopher & Peck, 2004; Jain et al., 2017; Shekarian et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2019; Svensson, 2000). Hence, redundancies or \"safety nets\" (Andreas & Wallenburg, 2012) have to be embedded in the SC networks to stabilize the network during supply, production, and transportation disruptions times (Ivanov et al., 2017). Among the prominent strategies to build redundancies in robust SC networks to enhance resilience are multiple sourcing, increased inventory, backup production capacity (A. Ali et al., 2017; Ivanov et al., 2017), supplier segregation, multiple transportation channels, backup suppliers, and raw materials substitutions (Hosseini et al., 2019; Hosseini & Barker, 2016). ",

Supplier selection, one of the sourcing decisions, is a multi-criteria decision-making problem (Cavalcante et al., 2019; Hosseini & Khaled, 2019; G. Li, 2007), and the primary criteria are cost, quality, lead time, service level, and flexibility (Hosseini & Barker, 2016). However, suppliers are the most common source of external disruption risks in modern supply chains. According to the report by (Hosseini et al., 2019), more than half of SC disruptions emerge from the first-tier suppliers and affect the entire SC through propagation(the ripple effect). Supplier disruptions can impose huge losses on the entire SC as they cut all the flows (Hosseini & Khaled, 2019). Therefore, the supplier selection process must also consider the suppliers' ability to mitigate risk or resilience (Nepal & Yadav, 2015; Rajesh & Ravi, 2015). Resilient supplier development and evaluation had helped firms obtain better performance when similar disruptions affected similar suppliers (Cavalcante et al., 2019). As a result, resilient sourcing has become one of the critical antecedents of SCRes. ",

The collaborative partnership helps to anticipate disruptions and manage risks efficiently (Singh et al., 2019). Collaboration in SCs is interpreted by Parast et al. (2019) as the \"glue that holds firms in crisis together.\" It is apparent that since SC vulnerability and resilience are network-wide concepts, the management of disruptions risks has to be network-wide too (Christopher & Peck, 2004). Incentive alignment and decision synchronization are critical as they are essential to successfully responding to disruptions in SCs (Shekarian & Mellat Parast, 2021). ",

Situation awareness enhances the sensitivity of SCs to poetical threats to the SC network. Overall, SC understanding is necessary to identify the critical path and potential bottlenecks in SCs (Christopher & Peck, 2004). This can be facilitated by modeling and mapping tools (A.

        "text": "For the rationale behind our findings, especially on the readiness phase, we draw insights on four issues. The first is the need to be prepared for the unexpected/unknown of SCs to be more resilient. By definition, resiliency is anticipating and preparing for the unexpected, especially for disruptive risks of low probability and high consequence. The second is the ease of use and effectiveness of AI technologies for anticipating in the readiness phase (Spieske & Birkel, 2021). The third is the tendency of researchers to focus on the readiness phase as recommended by prior researchers in the field of SCRes (A. Ali et al., 2017; Hohenstein et al., 2015). The fourth is a paradigm shift by SC practitioners that used to present reluctance to the proactive SCM activities and assume the risks of disruptions are uncertain and time-consuming (Grötsch et al., 2013) to a more resilient focused perception. The recent disruptive events like the Tornadoes, Brexit, the US-Chinese war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and cutting-edge (disruptive) AI technologies in SCRes have triggered the research interests focusing on the readiness phase of SCRes. No reference from our sample addresses the growth phase of SCRes. This is also similar to the results obtained by Spieske & Birkel (2021). Zamani et al. (2022) also reported AI's unexplored capability to contribute to the growth (adaptation) phase of SCRes. Previous systematic literature reviews on SCRes also indicate that few studies focus on the growth phase (A. Ali et al., 2017; Hohenstein et al., 2015). It is evident that the long-term perspective of SCRes on SCs has been missed (Spieske & Birkel, 2021). However, the lessons learned from disruptions and making faster responses than the competitors can help firms gain a competitive advantage (Abeysekara et al., 2019; Jüttner & Maklan, 2011; Patel et al., 2022) after the disruptions are gone.

For instance, Lawrence et al. (2020) leveraged expert elicited-BN to model and analyze supplier vulnerability to severe weather risk. Lockamy & McCormack (2012) also used BN to develop supplier risk profiles to determine the risk exposure of a company's revenue stream. Liu et al. (2021) used dynamic BN for disruption risk assessment under the supply chain ripple effect. Hosseini et al.

In order to facilitate resilient sourcing, policymakers can come up with alternative national sourcing strategies and even can relax stringent national sourcing strategies that hinder the degree of flexibility during disruptions times. Regarding AI and related digital technologies, policymakers can subsidize investment in developing new and innovative AI techniques and algorithms that can benefit resiliency in supply chains. This can provide SC practitioners with affordable, innovative digital technologies. Policymakers are also expected to cultivate and enforce the culture of data collection that enable SCs to clarify future uncertainties by implementing ML algorithms. ",

This can keep the attention of SC practitioners in the direction of long-term SCRes benefits and the possibilities to attain competitive advantages after disruptions are gone. Concerning the critical antecedents of SCRes, the findings revealed that less attention has been given to velocity (2%) and resilient sourcing (6%) antecedents of SCRes by references in the sample. Speedy detection of anomalies, developing recovery plans faster, and responding to disruptions quickly are crucial elements of SCRes and help to reap the advantages of first movers in a given business during disruptions in addition to being resilient. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the velocity antecedent of SCRes in the recent future.

        "table_body": "<table><tr><td>AI techniques /Algorithm</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-agent intelligent systems (MAIS)</td><td>A subfield of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) to solve distributed problems (Akerkar, 2019) by using independent agents (Marsh, 1992; Z. Zhang &amp; Zhang, 2004). A complex control problem can be divided into several simple problems, being each control unit self-contained, processing its goals, skills, knowledge, and a set of rules that regulate its behavior. A multi agent system refers to a group of autonomous intelligent agents that collaborate (share information) to solve common tasks or make decisions that are beyond the individual capabilities or knowledge (Z. Zhang &amp; Zhang, 2004) within a dynamic environment (Giannakis &amp; Louis, 2011; Lo et al., 2008; Saraeian et al., 2019) in a decentralized autonomous planning systems (Marsh, 1992; Wooldridge &amp; Jennings, 1995). MAIS integrates several AI techniques from different subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, machine learning, planning, coordination, communication, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic algorithm (GA)</td><td>A global search heuristics algorithm based on the idea of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; biological evolution and heredity (Tong et al., 2020). In AI and ML, search is used in both learning (from data or examples) and reasoning, and GA is used in this context (Shapiro, 2001; Sharma et al., 2020). It is used to find optimal solutions for difficult problems that would otherwise take decades (Akerkar, 2019). The algorithms iteratively select better solutions and uses them for generating new candidates in order to &quot;evolve&quot; the population (Y. Liu et al., 2020; Russel &amp; Norvig, 2010).</td></tr><tr><td>Rough set theory (RST)</td><td>It was developed by (Pawlak, 1982) to classify and deal with imprecise, inconsistent, uncertain, or incomplete information and knowledge(Parmar et al., 2010; Pawlak, 1982; Qinghua et al., 2016), and to aid approximations in decision support (G. Li, 2007). Incomplete or inconsistent information can be encountered when the available feature set describing data samples does not suffice to discern between them, that is, the dataset contains elements having the same values for all features but different values for the related outcomes. It classifies objects into similarity classes (clusters) containing objects that are indiscernible with respect to previous occurrences and knowledge. Then, the similarity cases are employed to determine various patterns within the data (Bai et al., 2017; Parmar et al., 2010).</td></tr><tr><td>Fuzzy logic (FL)</td><td>It is a subset of the fuzzy set theory proposed by (Zadeh, 1965). It is a technique of reasoning that resembles human reasoning (Russel &amp; Norvig, 2010) dealing with uncertainties in data, information and knowledge by summarizing data and focusing on decision relevant information (Klement &amp; Slany, 1997; Luger, 2009; Serena et al., 2008). Uncertainty relates to the notions of imprecision, randomness, incompleteness, unreliability, vagueness, and fuzziness (Klement &amp; Slany, 1997). In general terms, FL can handle ambiguity, impression, and ambiguity of objects (Min, 2010). The main reason for using FL in AI in general and expert systems in particular is that much of the information contained in knowledge-based systems is uncertain in nature (Kandel &amp; Schneider, 1989).ML algorithms</td></tr><tr><td>Artificial neural networks (ANNs)</td><td>They simulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks of the human brain in learning to perform specific tasks. The basic building block of an ANN is a neuron that is a simple mathematical model (function) having three simple sets of rules namely multiplication, summation, and activation. The weights of the network learn to reduce the error between prediction by the ANN and the true value provided by the training data.</td></tr><tr><td>Bayesian networks(BNs)</td><td>BNs are structured based on Baye&#x27;s theorem and probability theory (Drury et al., 2017; Hosseini &amp; Ivanov, 2020; Neil et al., 2005). The ability to perform inference and causal modeling under uncertain knowledge are one of their most powerful features (Fenton &amp; Neil, 2019; Neil et al., 2005; Russel &amp; Norvig, 2010). The BN structure and parameters are developed either based on domain knowledge (expert elicited) or by learning from data by implementing either supervised or unsupervised ML techniques (Huang et al., 2020; Heckerman, 2008; Hosseini &amp; Ivanov, 2020). Baye&#x27;s classifier, Dynamic and static Bayesian networks are the most frequently utilized types of BNs in AI and ML.</td></tr><tr><td>Decision tree (DT)</td><td>It is one of the simplest and yet the most successful machine learning algorithm (Joshi, 2020; Mohri et al., 2018; Russel &amp; Norvig, 2010) that represents a function that takes as input a vector of attribute values and returns a single output value (decision) (Ni et al., 2020; Russel &amp; Norvig, 2010; Toorajipour et al., 2021) DT displays possible consequences with different graphs and each node of the graph contribute to one specific feature (Ni et al., 2020). It falls under both classification and regression categories of ML tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>Random forest (RF)</td><td>To cope with the overfitting in a DT, the random forest (RM) algorithm was proposed (Joshi, 2020). RF fits many regression and classification trees to a data set, and then combines the prediction from all the trees (Cutler et al., 2007; Fukuda et al., 2014). The algorithms start with the selection of many bootstrap samples from the dataset. A classification and regression tree are fit to each of the bootstrapped samples, but at each node, only a small number of randomly selected variables are available for binary partitioning. The trees fully grow and each is used to predict the out-of-bag (OOB) observations (Cutler et al., 2007; Joshi, 2020; Ni et al., 2020).</td></tr><tr><td>Ensemble learning(EL)</td><td>EL is a general Meta approach in ML, which seeks superior predictive performance by combining the predictions from multiple algorithms. EL algorithms are general techniques in ML for combining several predictors to create a more accurate (Mohri et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2020) and stronger one (Joshi, 2020). The idea of ensemble learning is to select a whole collection, or ensemble, of hypotheses from the hypotheses space and combine their prediction (Liakos et al., 2018; Russel &amp; Norvig, 2010) and to reduce overfitting. Each learner in the ensemble of learners captures certain aspects of information contained in the data which is utilized to train it (Joshi, 2020).</td></tr><tr><td>Deep learning(DL)</td><td>It refers to a set of machine learning algorithms that learn multiple levels of representations (Araque et al., 2017) in deep architectures (Al-Jarrah et al., 2015). In the term &quot;deep learning&quot; methodology, the term &quot;deep&quot; enumerates the concept of multiple hidden layers through which the data is transformed (Dargan et al., 2020; Schmidhuber, 2015). DL was proposed to overcome the incapability of the shallow ANNs (Janiesch et al., 2021; P. Kim, 2017) to handle big amounts of complex data which are common in many routine applications of AI like natural speech, images, information retrieval and other human-like information processing (Akerkar, 2019; Dargan et al., 2020). Autoencoders, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and self-organizing maps are the most popular DL algorithms that have applications in many fields (Akerkar, 2019; Dargan et al., 2020; Joshi, 2020).</td></tr><tr><td>K Means algorithm (km)</td><td>K-means is an unsupervised ML algorithm for clustering problems in pattern recognition and image processing(Likas et al., 2003; Mucherino et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2020). It is a method for finding cluster structure(into k clusters) in a dataset that is characterized by the greatest similarity (homogeneity) with the same cluster and the greatest dissimilarity(heterogeneity) between different clusters (Mucherino et al., 2009; Sinaga &amp; Yang, 2020).</td></tr><tr><td>Logistic regression (LR)</td><td>It is a supervised ML algorithm. LR is one of the most important statistical and data mining algorithms used by statisticians and researchers for the classification and analysis of binary and proportional response datasets (Agresti, 2008; Akerkar, 2019; Dreiseitl &amp; Ohno-machado, 2003; Joshi 2020; Mohri et al., 2018; Maalouf, 2011). LR algorithm takes continuous data as input and categorical (mostly binary) data as response (output) variables (Borucka, 2020).</td></tr></table>",
