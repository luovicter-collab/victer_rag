But to profit from a bubble, investors must exit the bubble before the sell-off erodes all of the profits. The authors propose two measures for managing exposure to bubbles. One measure, called asset centrality, locates crowded trading, which they show is often associated with the formation of bubbles. The other is a measure of relative value, which helps to separate crowding that occurs during a bubble’s run-up from crowding that occurs during a bubble’s sell-off. Neither measure by itself is sufficient for identifying the full cycle of a bubble, but the authors show that together these measures have the potential to locate bubbles in sectors and in factors as they begin to emerge and to identify exit points before they fully def late.

However, when prices change significantly from a shift in investor psychology or infatuation with a new strategy, it is likely due to crowded trading. This distinction is critical. Price adjustments that correspond to shifting fundamentals should persist indef initely, which makes them difficult to exploit, but price adjustments that occur in the absence of a shift in fundamentals are more likely to be transitory and, therefore, more easily exploitable. This type of crowded trading, in which asset prices rise and fall significantly without a commensurate change in fundamental value, is commonly referred to as a bubble.

We use the square root of market weights because large sectors are likely to be more connected, but at some point, connectivity reaches a saturation level; hence, we assume this relationship is nonlinear. Others may prefer to use a different adjustment factor for market capitalization weights. Our findings are not highly sensitive to this choice. Other market weighting methodologies produced similar results.

Second, the factor timing strategy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by $6 . 3 \\%$ . This greater outperformance suggests that, even if factors do not deliver risk premiums, it is still possible that factor timing can add value, just as sector rotation adds value even though aggregate sectors, by construction, cannot outperform the market.

We showed that centrality, by itself, is insuff icient for managing exposure to bubbles because it continues to rise and, often, more sharply when crowding coincides with a bubble sell-off. Also, relative value, by itself, is inadequate for managing exposure to bubbles because it fails to distinguish price changes that occur in response to changes in fundamental value from those that result from a shift in investor psychology or herding toward a new strategy. We found, however, that these measures used in tandem could identify run-ups and sell-offs of sector and factor bubbles. We produced a backtest showing that investors could have significantly outperformed the US equity market as well as several foreign equity markets by employing a sector rotation strategy based on these measures. We also produced an additional backtest showing that investors could have significantly outperformed the US equity market as well as a static factor portfolio by using these measures to time exposure to factors. We also applied the same methodology used in Exhibits 4 and 8 to US industries and commodities, which produced consistent results. The annualized spread between the run-up and sell-off phases for US industries was $7 . 6 \\%$ , and for commodities it was $1 1 . 1 \\%$ . These results suggest that our methodology has applications to many other markets and investment universes. ",
